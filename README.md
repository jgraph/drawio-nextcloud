## Mimetype detection ##

To make Draw.io work properly, you need to add a new mimetypes in the `mimetypemapping.json` file (at Nextcloud level).

Go to `Admin settings > Additional settings` ( `/index.php/settings/admin/additional` ) and click the `Save` button to register MIME types.

Or you can do it manually:
- Download [mimetypemapping.json](https://github.com/pawelrojek/nextcloud-drawio/raw/master/mimetypemapping.json) and save it in `config` folder
or 
- Copy `/resources/config/mimetypemapping.dist.json` to `/config/mimetypemapping.json` 
(in the `config/` folder at Nextcloud’s root directory; the file should be stored next to the `config.php` file). 
Afterwards add the two following line just after the “_comment” lines.
    "drawio": ["application/x-drawio"],

If all other mimetypes are not working properly, just run the
following command:

    sudo -u www-data php occ files:scan --all
